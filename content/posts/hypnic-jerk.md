Why is it that \
we fall hundreds of feet \
off of a tall building or a lonely cliff \
forever is a long time \
only to wake up in bed, \
heart pounding \
drenched in sweat \
wondering what — \
did my body just malfunction?

I imagine our primate ancestor \
in a savannah \
sleeping peacefully on a tree branch \
he's probably dreaming about sex. \
He smiles \
his furry limbs unwind and relax \
body starts to slip out from underneath — \
only to wake up in bed \
heart pounding \
drenched in sweat \
wondering why in the hell he was dreaming about primates.

*Random facts:*
1. *[Hypnic jerks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnic_jerk) are involuntary muscle contractions when a person is falling asleep, often accompanied by a falling sensation. 70% of people experience it at least once. 10% experience it daily. One of the theories as to why this happens is that it prevented sleeping primates from falling out of trees. More evidence is needed.*
2. *'Primate' is also the [title or rank of important archbishops in the Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate_(bishop)).*
