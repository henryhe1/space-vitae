Hello internet wanderer! The idea of a static blog was inspired by my good friend Edward [(edho.me)](http://edho.me) and serves as a space for my thoughts and reflections. I started it in order to write more, because I like writing and it helps me process life a bit better. Hopefully it is inspiring or interesting to you as well. 

I am a second year medical student in Canada, so many of the posts will probably be medicine-related. Other potential topics include tech, music, and fitness, and I'll try my best to organize them with tags for easy navigation. Thank you for joining me on this journey.

### tech stuff

This blog is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open-source static site generator written in the programming language Go. I chose a theme called [Hugo Vitae](https://github.com/dataCobra/hugo-vitae), because of its simplicity and focus on content. The code for this website can be found [here](https://github.com/henryhe1/space-vitae).

The font you are reading is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans).

If you're curious, this was what my [old website](https://henryhe.me/old-website) looked like. I created it in Nov 2015 after I got this (awesome) domain name free for 1 year by attending my university hackathon.
