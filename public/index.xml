          <description>COVID-19 and climate change
Monday, April 6, 2020.
Estimated reading time: 10 minutes… but there are pretty pictures!
I attended an online webinar the other day organized by the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE). The session was titled “COVID-19 and climate change - Where do we go from here?” and consisted of a panel of speakers, including physicians and other board members of the organization. I was interested because I had heard something about carbon emissions dropping ever since people have been staying home and the economy has been slowing down.</description>

          <description>So I like making music. I play piano, guitar, and sing, and I make my own beats too. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the greatest voice nor the greatest musical talent, but I love making covers of my favourite songs, because it&amp;rsquo;s a chance to experience them on a deeper level. I want to put out some originals eventually as well.
Some of my biggest influences are Daniel Caesar, David Choi, Khalil Fong, Rex Orange County, Post Malone, John Mayer, Chance the Rapper, Still Woozy, Radiohead, Queen, Fun, and Marianas Trench, in no particular order.</description>

          <description>&amp;hellip;#7 changed my LIFE!! Lol
Starting med school has been simultaneously the most exciting and the most overwhelming time of my life. It’s only been a month, and I already feel a lot of the responsibilities of “being a doctor”. Like Shakespeare wrote in Twelfth Night, it’s kind of been thrust upon me, all of a sudden. Starting the Problem Based Learning (PBL) model here at Mac was a little analogous to being thrown into the deep end, where at least before there were familiar creatures like marked exams and projects—have now been replaced by a void of vague tutorial objectives, optional anatomy labs, and “professional competency”.</description>

          <description>Hello internet wanderer! The idea of a static blog was inspired by my good friend Ed (edho.me) and serves as a space for my thoughts and reflections. We&amp;rsquo;re all in this swirling, sometimes laminar and sometimes turbulent river called life, but if we just step out and sit on the shore every once in a while, I believe it can lead to a more enriched and personally meaningful experience. I just started medical school in Canada, so many of the posts will probably be medicine-related.</description>
