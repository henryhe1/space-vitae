      <description>The Opioid Crisis, Soylent, and Retaining Humanity  Red opium poppy plants. Photo by Marten Bjork on Unsplash
I learned recently that Americans are the highest opioid users per capita in the world. That was no surprise. However, this next fact made me stop and think: there is no evidence that Americans experience any more pain than people from other countries.
A 2019 Lancet study found that the use of opioid analgesics (painkillers) in the USA far exceeds its use in other nations.</description>

      <description>Humility in medicine and in life  Photo by J√∂rg Angeli on Unsplash
The Hippocratic Oath is an oath of ethics traditionally taken by final year medical students as they graduate and become new physicians. In the modern version of the oath, new doctors are reminded of the importance of humility, and are encouraged to ‚Äúnot be ashamed to say ‚ÄòI know not,‚Äô nor to call on colleagues when the skills of another are needed for a patient‚Äôs recovery.</description>

      <title>Compassion vs. Burnout</title>

      <description>A reminder of the limits of medicine  Clinician burnout is a huge problem in medicine, and can lead to lower patient care quality, higher medical error risk, physician alcohol and drug abuse and addiction, and physician suicide (source). In Canada, 30% of residents and practicing physicians report experiencing burnout (emotional exhaustion and/or depersonalization) at least weekly. Just last week, an emergency physician working in the COVID-19 units in New York died by suicide ‚Äî now we don‚Äôt know the precise circumstances around her death, but based on the New York Times article, I think it is fair to say that stress from work likely played a role.</description>

      <description>Spoiler‚Ä¶it‚Äôs $10 million USD.  I heard a fascinating podcast episode from Planet Money titled ‚ÄúLives Vs. The Economy‚Äù recently, and it blew my mind.
It addressed the question that has been asked more and more recently in the public discourse: ‚Äúis it ever worth it to shut down the economy to save lives?‚Äù, or in other words, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we open back up? I need to go back to work!</description>

      <description>Part of my story and what I learned from the process  I am a current second year medical student studying in Canada. Over the past couple years, I have had the pleasure to be able to give some advice and mentorship to friends in lower years. I personally reached out to many upper-year students for help when I was applying, so I am more than happy to give back.</description>

      <description>Self-management of anxiety in a stressful world  Disclaimer: I am not a physician and this is not medical advice. It is just what I learned from a recent (virtual) psychiatry lecture. Please contact your family physician if you need medical care, this includes anything to do with mental illness.

      <description>Why is it that
we fall hundreds of feet
off of a tall building or a lonely cliff
forever is a long time
only to wake up in bed,
heart pounding
drenched in sweat
wondering what ‚Äî
did my body just malfunction?
I imagine our primate ancestor
in a savannah
sleeping peacefully on a tree branch
he&amp;rsquo;s probably dreaming about sex.
He smiles
his furry limbs unwind and relax
body starts to slip out from underneath ‚Äî</description>

This should go without saying, but the following opinions are mine and mine alone.
Source: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html as of April 10, 2020 at 11:50AM.
The Pandemic Situation I‚Äôve been thinking about this deeply for the past couple of days. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide continues to climb above 1.6 million, the number of deaths is more than 100 times the number of deaths from the 2003 SARS outbreak and more than 4 times the number of deaths from the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.</description>

      <description>Estimated reading time: 10 minutes‚Ä¶ but there are pretty pictures!
I attended an online webinar the other day organized by the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE). The session was titled ‚ÄúCOVID-19 and climate change - Where do we go from here?‚Äù and consisted of a panel of speakers, including physicians and other board members of the organization. I was interested because I had heard something about carbon emissions dropping ever since people have been staying home and the economy had been slowing down.</description>

      <title>7 Tips for Starting Med School</title>

      <description>&amp;hellip;#7 changed my LIFE!! Lol
Starting med school has been simultaneously the most exciting and the most overwhelming time of my life. It‚Äôs only been a month, and I already feel a lot of the responsibilities of ‚Äúbeing a doctor‚Äù. Like Shakespeare wrote in Twelfth Night, it‚Äôs kind of been thrust upon me, all of a sudden. Starting the Problem Based Learning (PBL) model here at Mac was a little analogous to being thrown into the deep end, where at least before there were familiar creatures like marked exams and projects‚Äîhave now been replaced by a void of vague tutorial objectives, optional anatomy labs, and ‚Äúprofessional competency‚Äù.</description>
